                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Blend the tomatoes, onions, and peppers until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Boil down the tomato sauce in a pot until the sauce has thickened to look like a paste.</li>
                    <li>In a large wok or skillet, pour vegetable oil, then add sliced onions. Allow to fry until soft and brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the reduced tomato paste, fry for another 5-8 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add salt and Onga classic powder. Fry for a few minutes and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot of boiling water, add two teaspoons of salt, then add in the spaghetti, push it down or break it to fit into the pot.</li>
                    <li>Cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on medium heat.</li>
                    <li>After 5 minutes, stir, turn down the heat to low, and allow to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Sieve out the pasta water (but keep the water for later use).</li>
                    <li>Add the boiled spaghetti into the fried sauce and stir until the sauce is well incorporated. You can add some of the spaghetti water to soften and cook for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Serve with any protein of your choice.</li>
                </ol>
