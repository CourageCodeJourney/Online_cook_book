                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>These cupcakes are perfect for birthday parties and baby showers and they always disappear fast which is why I always make a double batch for gatherings. They are quick and easy to make and homemade cupcakes taste way better than boxed cupcake mix.</p>

                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                            <li>In a second bowl (or bowl of your stand mixer), beat together softened butter and sugar on medium-high speed 5 minutes until thick and fluffy.</li>
                            <li>Beat in eggs 1 at a time, mixing to incorporate with each egg then blend in vanilla and scrape down the bowl.</li>
                            <li>Reduce mixer to medium speed and add the flour in thirds, alternating with adding the 1/2 cup buttermilk and beating well between additions.</li>
                            <li>Pour batter into 12 lined muffin tins, filling 2/3 full. Bake in the center of the oven at 350˚F for 20-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                            <li>Let cool 5 minutes in the pan then remove cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                        </ol>         
                        <h3>How to Decorate Cupcakes</h3>
                        <p>Once your cupcakes are cooled to room temperature, it’s time to decorate. This is a great vanilla cupcake base for just about any kind of frosting and toppings. We pipe frosting on with a pastry bag and our favorite Wilton 1M Tip. We have so many frosting options so pick your craving:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Vanilla Cupcake Frosting – our go-to cupcake frosting</li>
                            <li>Swiss Meringue Buttercream – well worth the extra effort</li>
                            <li>Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting – whipped and decadent</li>
                            <li>Blackberry Frosting – you’ll love the flavor and color</li>
                        </ol>                        
                        <h3>Notes</h3>
                        <p>For even batter, use room temperature ingredients and alternate adding flour with buttermilk.</p>
                        <p>Measure precisely and avoid overfilling liners (2/3 full) to prevent muffin tops. An ice cream scoop helps portion batter evenly.</p>
