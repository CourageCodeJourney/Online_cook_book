                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                            <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
                            <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
                            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Notes</h3>
                        <p>You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup without ruining the recipe. Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's flavor if overcooked.</p>
