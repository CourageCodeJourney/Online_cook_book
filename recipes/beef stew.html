                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Season the beef: Pat the beef chunks dry with paper towels, then season them with a good amount of salt and pepper.</li>
                            <li>Sear the beef: In a large stockpot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, place the beef in the pot and sear on all sides until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Then, remove the seared beef to a plate.</li>
                            <li>Saute the onion: Add the onion and garlic to the pot and pour in the vinegar. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until the onion is softened. Add the tomato paste and cook for an additional minute.</li>
                            <li>Return the beef to the pot: Add the seared beef back to the pot and sprinkle flour on top. Stir everything together until the flour is fully dissolved.</li>
                            <li>Add the liquids and aromatics: Pour in the wine and beef broth, then add the thyme and bay leaf. Stir everything together and bring the broth to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer partially covered for 1 hour.</li>
                            <li>Add the veggies: Add the potatoes, carrots, and celery to the pot. Cook for an additional 20 to 30 minutes or until the vegetables are fork-tender.</li>
                            <li>Finish and serve: Remove the bay leaves from the stew. If desired, garnish with fresh thyme before serving. Enjoy your delicious beef stew!</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        
                        <h3>Notes</h3>
                        <p>For short-term storage throughout the week, place any leftover beef stew in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator. It will keep well for 4 to 5 days, but note that it may thicken slightly over time. If needed, add a splash of water to thin it down when reheating. For longer-term storage, consider freezing portions of the stew for later enjoyment. Transfer the stew to airtight containers suitable for freezing and store them in the freezer. Properly stored, the beef stew will maintain its quality for up to 3 months. Having a stash of this hearty dish in the freezer is a delightful treat, particularly on a chilly day, providing a convenient and satisfying meal option whenever needed.</p>
