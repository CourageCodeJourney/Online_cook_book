                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>A great recipe for an electric breadmaker – or do it the traditional way. A dough's first rising can be done in the fridge overnight. This slows down the time it takes to rise to double its size, giving it a deeper flavour. It's also a great timesaver, as you can start it the night before, then finish it off the next day.</p>

                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Combine 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt, and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
                            <li>Make a well in the center, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water. Mix well. If the dough seems stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water.</li>
                            <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes until smooth.</li>
                            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with cling film, and leave to rise for 1 hour or overnight in the fridge.</li>
                            <li>Line a baking tray with baking parchment.</li>
                            <li>Knock back the dough, shape it into a ball, and place it on the parchment.</li>
                            <li>Leave the dough to prove for another hour.</li>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
                            <li>Dust the loaf with flour and cut a cross on top.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
