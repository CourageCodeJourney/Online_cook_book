                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Lemon blueberry French toast is the breakfast food my family always asks me to make.  Seeded semolina bread is soaked in a mixture of vanilla, eggs, sugar, and cream and fried until golden.  Fresh blueberries, lemon zest, and copious amounts of powdered sugar seal the deal on this very simple but delicious breakfast.</p>

                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat your oven to its lowest temperature or 170Â°F and set the rack to the middle level.</li>
                            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, sugar, and vanilla.</li>
                            <li>Heat a non-stick pan to medium-low heat and add 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
                            <li>Soak 4 pieces of bread in the bowl for at least 30 seconds. Remove bread from the bowl, letting it drip for a bit, and place it into the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side or until golden on both sides.</li>
                            <li>Place cooked French toast onto a baking sheet and right into the oven to keep warm. Add a bit more butter to the pan and repeat the frying process for subsequent batches.</li>
                            <li>When all the pieces are finished cooking, plate and divide the blueberries and lemon zest. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with some melted butter and maple syrup. Enjoy!</li>
                        </ol>
